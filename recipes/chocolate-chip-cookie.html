     <p>A chocolate chip cookie is a sweet baked 
         treat that is recognized by its butter 
         flavor and the inclusion of chocolate chips. 
         Some variations can include nuts, 
         oatmeal or raisins as well.</p>
    <p>Chocolate chip cookies were created in the 1930s by the 
        Massachusetts cook Ruth Wakerfield, and were originally 
        called Toll House Chocolate Crunch Cookie.</p>
    <p>In 1939, Nestlé introduced to the market chocolate chips or 
       morsels and started printing Wakerfield’s recipe on the package. 
       In 1953, the chocolate chip cookie mix by Pillsbury was introduced 
       to the US market. Today, chocolate chip cookies are the most popular 
       cookies in the US.</p>
