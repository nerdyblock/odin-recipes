    <p>Hash browns, also spelled hashed browns, are a popular American and British breakfast food, consisting of finely chopped potatoes that have been fried until browned. Hash browns first started appearing on breakfast menus in New York City in the 1890s. Hash browns are a staple breakfast food at diners in North America, where they are often fried on a large common cooktop or grill.</p>
    <p>In some parts of the United States, hash browns strictly refer to shredded or riced pan-fried potatoes, while diced and pan-fried potatoes are called country fried potatoes or home fries and are served as a side dish at other meals. Some recipes add diced or chopped onions.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 russet potatoes, peeled </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons clarified butter </li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste </li>
        <li>1 pinch paprika, or to taste </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Shred potatoes into a large bowl filled with cold water. Stir until water is cloudy, drain, and cover potatoes again with fresh cold water. Stir again to dissolve excess starch. Drain potatoes well, pat dry with paper towels, and squeeze out any excess moisture.</li>
        <li>Heat clarified butter in a large non-stick pan over medium heat. Sprinkle shredded potatoes into the hot butter and season with salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and paprika.</li>
        <li>Cook potatoes until a brown crust forms on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Continue to cook and stir until potatoes are browned all over, about 5 more minutes.</li>
